This project trains a logistic regression model to predict whether a person has heart disease based on 21 different features, such as whether or not they have high blood pressure, BMI, whether or not they smoke, their age, whether or not they eat veggies, etc., pulled from a dataset from Kaggle.
To run the code, open the Python notebook file in Colab and upload the dataset to the runtime.

With around 260,000 rows and 21 features, the code takes quite some time to run.
